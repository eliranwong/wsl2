The one on the left is pengwin terminal, the one on the right is gnome-terminal.

You can see pengwin terminal does not display Chinese and Hebrew characters in unicode.

Though it is possible to change the font setting of pengwin terminal, we yet to find a single font that is able to display all languages.

# Alternatives

We tested the following terminal apps on WSL2.
