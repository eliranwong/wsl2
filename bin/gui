# This script helps running gui applications under WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux Version 2)
# Fixes on various issues of running gui apps under WSL2 are integrated in this script.

# Connect to display server
export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0.0
# For complex network, comment the line above and uncomment the following 9 lines to allow user entry of ip address.
#echo Enter the ip address of your display server:
#echo [Or enter nothing to use default setting]
#read ipAddress
#if [ -n "$ipAddress" ]
#then
#    export DISPLAY=$ipAddress:0.0
#else
#    export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0.0
#fi

# Show DISPLAY variable
echo DISPLAY=$DISPLAY

# To work with Xresources, uncomment the following line.
#xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources

# To work better with mesa-utils
export -n LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT

# Set QStandardPaths
mkdir -p /tmp/runtime-$USER
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/runtime-$USER

# Input method [Optional]
# We recommend using ibus as input method for non-latin languages in version 2 of WSL.
# To use ibus, you have to install it first.
# You may find instructions on installing ibus with the following link:
# https://github.com/eliranwong/Chrome-OS-Linux/blob/master/others/windows_wsl.md#ibus
# Uncomment the following 8 lines to lanuch ibus service & set variables:
#dbus-launch ibus-daemon -x -d
#export LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.UTF-8
#export XIM=ibus
#export XIM_PROGRAM=/usr/bin/ibus
#export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
#export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
#export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
#export DefaultIMModule=ibus

# Remarks:
# With regards to input method, you may consider fcitx, but we found that fcitx is very broken under in version 2 of WSL.

# Run a gui application
echo GUI environment is now ready.
echo Enter your command:
read userCommand
if [ -z "$userCommand" ]
then
    echo Nothing to run!
else

    # Alternatively,
    #export $(dbus-launch --exit-with-x11 | grep DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS)
    #$userCommand & disown
