# Fixes on various issues of running gui apps under WSL2 are integrated in this script.

#echo [Or enter nothing to use default setting]
#read ipAddress

# To work better with mesa-utils

# To correct DBUS_SESSION

# Input method [Optional]
# We recommend using ibus as input method for non-Latin languages in version 2 of WSL.
# You may consider to use fcitx instead of ibus, but fcitx does not work in many applications.
# To use ibus, you have to install it first.
# You may find instructions on installing ibus with the following link:
# https://github.com/eliranwong/wsl2/blob/master/input_method/ibus.md
# Uncomment the following 8 lines to launch ibus service & set variables:
#export LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.UTF-8
#export XIM=ibus
#export XIM_PROGRAM=/usr/bin/ibus
#export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
#export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
#export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
#export DefaultIMModule=ibus
#ibus-daemon -drx

echo GUI environment is now ready.
